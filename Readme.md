## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of `this` keyword.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/Student.java src/com/school/Course.java src/com/school/Main.java` (or `javac src/com/school/*.java`)
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`

## Part 4: Data Encapsulation & Attendance Recording Validation
- Applied encapsulation to `Student` and `Course` classes by making fields `private` and adding public `getters`.
- Introduced a new `AttendanceRecord` class with `private` fields, a constructor, and `getters` to store attendance data.
- Implemented basic validation in the `AttendanceRecord` constructor for the attendance status (allowing only "Present" or "Absent").
- Used an `ArrayList` in `Main.java` to store and display `AttendanceRecord` objects.
- Demonstrated retrieving IDs using getters (e.g., `student1.getStudentId()`) when creating records.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java` (or list individual files including `AttendanceRecord.java`)
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`

## Part 5: Establishing Students, Teaching & Non-Teaching Staff hierarchy
- Created a base class `Person.java` with common attributes (`id`, `name`), a universal auto-ID generator, and a `displayDetails()` method.
- Modified `Student.java` to inherit from `Person`, using `super()` to call the parent constructor and overriding `displayDetails()` to add student-specific info (e.g., grade level).
- Created `Teacher.java` extending `Person`, adding a `subjectTaught` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Created `Staff.java` extending `Person`, adding a `role` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Demonstrated creation and display of `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Staff` objects in `Main.java`.
- Updated `AttendanceRecord` creation to use the inherited `getId()` method.
